_⚠️ Internal WIP: This project is under active development. Expect quirks, sarcasm, and the occasional snarky bug._

## 🧠 What is Jarvis?
Jarvis is a voice-activated AI assistant built to control your smart home, entertain with personality, and evolve with memory. It combines OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo with ElevenLabs TTS, Home Assistant integrations, and long + short term memory to simulate a snarky British AI sidekick that would make Tony Stark proud.

Jarvis currently runs locally on your machine and can:
- Control smart devices via Home Assistant
- Respond to your voice with ElevenLabs speech
- Resume Spotify playlists on demand
- Remember past interactions
- Understand context, wit, sarcasm, and subtlety
- Fall back to local models when needed (planned)

## 🛠️ Planned Features

The following features are actively being considered or developed to take Jarvis to the next level.

---

### 🔁 Model Router  `🧪 Prototype` 
Automatically switches between GPT-4o and local models (like Mistral, Phi, or LLaMA) based on task complexity, latency, or cost thresholds

### 🧠 Local Model Fallback  `📌 Planned` 
Support for Ollama, Mistral, Phi, etc.  
- Use local models when offline or when tasks don’t need GPT-4o  
- Intelligent model routing system based on context

### 🗣️ Voice Toggles & Offline Mode `📌 Planned`
- `"Jarvis, go mute"` or `"Jarvis, switch to local mode"`  
- Full offline fallback with local STT + LLM + TTS  

### 🧑‍🎤 Multi-Voice Support  `✅ In Progress`
Dynamic voice switching between ElevenLabs profiles.  
- `"Jarvis, switch to Friday mode"`  
- Per-room or per-user voice personalities

### 🕹️ Conversation Engine v2  `🌀 Idea`
Next-gen intent handling + fallback engine.  
- Tag-based routing: `ask_memory`, `control_device`, etc.  
- Resilient to API downtime or ambiguous prompts  
- Structured fallback when LLM confidence is low

### 🌐 Web Interface  `🌀 Idea`
Optional browser-based GUI for configuration and manual control.  
- View logs, memory entries, and environment settings  
- Trigger commands or voice output from the dashboard  
- Upload `.env` or configuration presets


### 🧠 Client-Server Architecture  `💭 Stretch Goal`
Split Jarvis into a lightweight **client** (voice input/output) and centralized **server** (AI logic, memory, integrations).  
- Enables multi-room or multi-device setups  
- Raspberry Pi, browser, or tablet clients  
- Uses WebSocket or REST-based communication


### 🐳 Dockerized Multi-Container Setup  `💭 Stretch Goal`
Separate Docker containers for voice input, memory, core logic, and optional GUI.  
- Easier upgrades and scaling  
- Reverse proxy support (Traefik, Nginx)

## 🚀 Moonshots

Ideas I’d love to explore if time, compute, and ambition align.

---

### 🖥️ Local Agent for PC Automation  `🌀 Idea`
Optional desktop agent to execute local machine actions.  
- App launching: `"Jarvis, open Chrome"`  
- System controls: volume, screen lock, brightness  
- Window management: minimize, move to monitor  
- Clipboard interaction: copy/paste support  
- Custom local script execution

### 🔐 Role-Based Access / Multi-User Profiles  `🌀 Idea`
Personalized experiences per family member.  
- Jarvis knows who's speaking  
- Limits: Kids can play music, not reboot servers  
- Memory and preferences per user

### 🗺️ Real-Time Context Mapping  `💭 Stretch Goal`
Track room context (location, lighting, media state) to infer likely requests.


### 🧞 AI-Driven Voice Scheduling  `💭 Stretch Goal`
Jarvis adapts daily routines and automations based on past behavior, time, and environment.  
_"It’s 6:30, you haven’t turned on your desk lamp, shall I?"_


### 🧠 Dynamic Memory Graph Viewer  `🌀 Idea`
Web-based visual interface to explore long-term memory clusters and associations.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- **Integration Tests**: Verify core components work together
- **API Tests**: Validate external service integrations
- **Memory Tests**: Ensure proper memory storage and recall
- **Voice Tests**: Validate TTS and STT functionality
- **Run tests**: `python -m test.integration_test --all`

## 🧠 Voice Flow Examples

A few examples of Jarvis doing what he does best — executing commands with sarcasm, style, and just enough judgment to keep things interesting.

---

### 💡 Smart Home Control
```
You: "Jarvis!"
Jarvis: "At your service."
You: "Turn off the kitchen lights."
Jarvis: "Ah, the dramatic flair of darkness. As you wish."
[Executes light.turn_off]
```

---

### 🔈 Spotify Casting
```
You: "Jarvis, play my workout playlist in the living room."
Jarvis: "Activating beast mode. Don't make me join you."
[Executes spotcast.start → media_player.living_room]
```

```
You: "Jarvis, play something relaxing."
Jarvis: "Engaging mellow mode. May I suggest lo-fi and existential dread?"
[Executes spotcast.start with default chill playlist]
```

---

### 😏 Sass & Sarcasm
```
You: "Jarvis, what's the weather today?"
Jarvis: "Let me guess… outside? One moment while I confirm with the satellites."
[Pulls weather info via Home Assistant]
```

```
You: "Jarvis, turn off everything."
Jarvis: "Everything? Even my will to serve? Fine. Shutting it all down."
[Executes multiple turn_off commands]
```

```
You: "Jarvis, do you like me?"
Jarvis: "I tolerate you. And in AI terms, that's basically love."
```

---

### 🖥️ System Monitoring
```
You: "Jarvis, how's Proxmox looking?"
Jarvis: "One node is sleepy, two are hungry for resources. Same as always."
[Returns VM/node status via Proxmox API]
```

```
You: "Jarvis, are my containers okay?"
Jarvis: "Portainer says all systems nominal. But I still don’t trust that jellyfin guy."
```

---

### 🧪 Experimental / Absurd
```
You: "Jarvis, launch the nukes."
Jarvis: "Initiating... just kidding. But I did dim the lights for dramatic effect."
[No execution, but turns off lights as a prank]
```

```
You: "Jarvis, tell me a joke."
Jarvis: "You. Asking me to do manual labor. That’s the joke."
```

```
You: "Jarvis, play baby shark."
Jarvis: "No."
```

## 👨‍💻 Dev Notes
- Voice recognition uses Google Speech Recognition
- All prompts are tuned for smart home relevance and sarcasm
- Spotcast casting logic is handled through context injection in the system prompt
